## Features

* **Payment Initiation**: Processes QRIS CPM payments through DANA.
* **Status Querying**: Checks the status of pending transactions.
* **Order Cancellation**: Cancels orders in cases of payment failures or timeouts.

## Architecture Overview

The service is structured into distinct components:

* **Services**: Business logic handling payment, query, and cancellation operations.
* **Repositories**: Interfaces for database interactions.
* **Models**: Structs representing data models.
* **Requests/Responses**: Structs for API request and response payloads.
* **Utilities**: Helper functions for tasks like signature generation.
* **Handlers**: Handling the Http Request from client.
* **Routes**: Managing api routes.

## Configuration

Ensure the following configurations are set, typically via environment variables or configuration files:

* **Client Secret**: Used for generating HMAC signatures.
* **Partner ID**: Provided by DANA.
* **External ID**: Unique identifier for external systems.
* **Channel ID**: Identifier for the communication channel.
* **Authorization Token**: Bearer token for API authentication.
* **API URLs**: Endpoints for payment, status, and cancellation APIs.

## Logging

The service logs each step of the transaction process, including:

* Incoming requests.
* Outgoing requests to DANA.
* Responses from DANA.
* Errors and exceptions.

Logs are stored in the `tracelog` repository for auditing and debugging purposes.

## Error Handling

The service returns appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages for various failure scenarios, such as:

* Invalid request payloads.
* Failed communication with DANA APIs.
* Internal server errors.

Ensure to handle these errors gracefully in your client applications.

## Dependencies

* **Go Modules**: Ensure all required Go modules are installed.
* **External Libraries**: Utilize standard libraries for HTTP requests, JSON handling, and cryptographic operations.
